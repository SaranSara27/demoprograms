Objectives:
	- NIO : Non Blocking Input Output
	- Data Munging - 4
	- Logical Exercise
	- Java-8 : NIO 
	
Non Blocking Input Output
	File--->Path
	- Path is the  location where the file is stored
	- methods  are provided to access the location
	
	Path p = Paths.get("c:/documents/dir/file.txt")
			Paths.get("c:/","documents","dir","file.txt")
		
- list(Path): First level of dir structure
- walk(Path): recursively walks through the entire dir structure
- find(Path): current dir and  sub dir

Reading From a File
	-  lines()--->Stream<String>
	- newBufferedReader(Path)
	- readAllLine-->List<String>
	
Writing into a File
	- write(Path,List<String)
